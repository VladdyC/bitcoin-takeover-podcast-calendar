# bitcoin-takeover-podcast-calendar
Here you will find all the episodes of the Bitcoin Takeover podcast, arranged by month. This should help future marketing efforts to promote older episodes within a context such as "On this day...". The structure is fairly simple: episodes of all years are arranged by month, with mentions of the date and the name of the guests.
